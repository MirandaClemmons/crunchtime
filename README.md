## Setup

It'd probably be a good idea to follow the [official guide](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/), but just 
in case, here's a basic rundown.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js

### Step 1

Run `npm install -g cordova ionic` in terminal

### Step 2

Run `npm install && bower install` in the project directory


That's pretty much it to get set up! Just make sure you execute any ionic commands from within the project folder.

## Development Instructions

`ionic serve`

Use this while developing. This command starts a local development server and watches/compiles SASS into CSS.
